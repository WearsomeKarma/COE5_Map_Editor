# COE5_Map_Editor
Map Editor for Conquest of Elysium 5

This is an old branch of the Editor being built on
Window's WPF. The Editor has since been fully
moved to OpenGL (via OpenTK) and using Gwen.Net
for the UI.

This way the editor works on Windows and Linux :)
(And so I can keep my sanity by working in Linux)
